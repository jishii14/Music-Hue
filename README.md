# Music-Hue
Node.js web app that calculates the best Philips Hue lighting setting given a song from Spotify.

Our app lets users search from among the vast Spotify music library or their own selected favorites to play music previews (provided by Spotify), and it calculates the color of lighting that matches the song given audio analysis of it from the API.  Songs that are good to dance to appear as more blue, songs that are more positive and energetic appear as more yellow, and songs that are more slow-paced appear red.

Uses Node for server, CSS/HTML/JavaScript + Handlebars and Bootstrap for visuals, and Spotify API for data.
